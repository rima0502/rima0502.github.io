      Hi, I’m dongrim.
      <br />
      I’m game developer. I graduated from DigiPen Academy Busan.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a developer, I solve problems and provide innovative solutions through
      various projects.
      <br />
      ​
      <br />
      Take a look at how I have solved problems through my experience and
      projects.

      Communication within the team was crucial throughout the game jam project.
      <br />
      We held regular scrum meetings and checked each team member&#039;s role and
      progress every hour.
      <br />
      This allowed us to track each other&#039;s progress and quickly exchange
      feedback where necessary.
      <br />
      In particular, I took on the role of mediating between the graphic designer
      and the programmer to ensure smooth communication.
      <br />
      I clearly conveyed the design and functional requirements, which helped keep
      the project on track and running smoothly.
